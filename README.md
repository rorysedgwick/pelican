#### what

A repository to serve as both a development environment to run Processing sketches and as a collection of my completed pieces.

#### how

Processing, although written in Java and executed through a Java engine in the Processing IDE, can be compiled to Javascript which can then run natively in any browser. Thanks to the processing-js node module for making this trivially easy to implement.

#### why

I am interested in the graphical possibilites of Processing and am keen to explore its capabilities. The Processing IDE itself is a little slow and fiddly, especially in JavaScript mode, so running sketches in the browser using a simple server will mean a quicker development loop. Also, because it is so easy to include sketches in web pages there may be interesting ways to enhance other sites that I work on in the future, including using user interaction to generate images or sound.
